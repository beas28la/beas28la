# 🚀 Welcome to Alex Chiang’s GitHub 👋

Hello! I’m Alex Chiang, a Data Science Master’s student at the University of Maryland and a passionate data scientist with a knack for solving real-world problems through machine learning, statistical analysis, and data-driven insights. Welcome to my GitHub, where I share my projects, research, and collaborative work.

## 🌟 About Me

I have a background in machine learning, data analysis, and software development. My work spans from implementing complex ML models to building efficient data pipelines and developing tools that enhance user experience and optimize processes. Here’s a bit more about what I do:

- **🔍 Research Interests**: Deep learning, NLP, and predictive modeling, especially in the tech industry, to support data-driven decision-making.
- **💡 Experience**: Former Data Center Technician Intern at Google, and active contributor to open-source projects and Kaggle competitions.
- **📊 Skills**: Python, R, SQL, PyTorch, and more, with experience in model compression, Bayesian inference, and real-time recommendation systems.

## 📂 Projects

Below are a few highlights of my work. Explore the repositories to dive into the code, models, and insights.

1.	**Battery Performance Analysis** - Analyzed high-voltage battery performance for BMW i3 using real-world driving data, applying regression and tree-based models.
2.	**ML-Powered Piano Chord Generation** - Developed a Recurrent Neural Network model in Python and PyTorch for generating piano chords in real-time.
3.	**Statistical Analysis of MLB and NBA Data** - Performed comparative analysis using R to identify non-traditional data’s impact on team performance.
4.	**Face Forgery Detection-Lips Don't Lie** - Utilized PyTorch and deep learning techniques to build a computer vision model for face forgery detection based on the “Lips Don’t Lie” paper by Alexandros Haliassos et al.
5.	**Personal Annual Income Forecast** - Predicted Annual Income Ranges of the American Population using Scikit-learn Models (decision trees, random forest).

Feel free to explore these projects, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!
